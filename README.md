# Steganography using Google Colab

This project demonstrates a simple steganography tool implemented in Python using Google Colab. Steganography is the art of hiding messages or information within another medium, such as images.

## Features
- **Message Embedding**: Hides a secret message inside an image by modifying pixel values.
- **Message Extraction**: Retrieves the hidden message from an image.
- **Passcode Security**: Requires a passcode for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Usage

### 1. Run the Notebook in Google Colab

1. Open the repository:
    ```
    https://github.com/ImAbhinavRanjan/Steganography
    ```
2. Open the `steg.ipynb` file in Google Colab:
    - Click on the notebook file and select `Open in Colab`.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to embed or extract a message.

### 2. Embedding a Message

- Provide the path to the image.
- Enter the message you want to hide.
- Enter a passcode to encrypt the message.
- The notebook will save the image with the hidden message.

### 3. Extracting a Message

- Provide the path to the image containing the hidden message.
- Enter the correct passcode used during embedding.
- The notebook will display the decrypted message.
